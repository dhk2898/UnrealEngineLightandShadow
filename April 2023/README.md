With the technical details of the level out of the way, the final level was designed as follows: 

The first puzzle of the game requires players to engage with the varying level-lighting from the start. Here if they adjust the slider they will be able to see that a shadow of a bridge will being to appear during the "daytime" hours of the slider (approximately, from
10~17). Using this, they have to align the shadow with the gap to the other side. If done correctly (the solution in this case was coded to be at around 14, with some leeway of about .5 on either direction) a bridge hidden under the water will appear for the player
to traverse and proceed to the next puzzle.

The next puzzle is a combination of utilizing the slider and the dual axis rotation from the previous level. Here the player will have to adjust the sun to cast the correct shadow in the background (roughly 7) and then rotate the shadow into the correct position. 
Following common sense, the puzzle here is of a bridge spanning two rocks. The player simply has to rotate the bridge into the correct position so that the bridge is placed correctly over both of the rocks and subsequently, a curved bridge will be raised from the water to guide
players to the final puzzle.

The final puzzle combines the slider and a physics puzzle to round finish the level. The previous puzzles asked the player to put the sun in positions of day and dusk, so the final puzzle requires players to put the sun all the way down to the dead of night. 
To make sure the players aren't stuck in a completely pitch black level, the backdrop of the second level was utilized again to create stars in the background. If positioned correctly (at roughly 3) a bridge with a guiding lamppost will rise and let players cross the gap
to the other side to place the cube on the pressure plate to open the final door. The players can then cross back over, set the lights back to any setting they wish and cross the bridge to the final platform which will take them back to the main menu.
