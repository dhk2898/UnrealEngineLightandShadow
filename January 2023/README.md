January was when I began to pull the previously designed puzzle elements, as well as overall level architecture together into one cohesive project. The goal of these levels was to introduce the player to the mechanics slowly one at a time. 
The first level would serve as a rudimentary teaching level for movement, interaction as well as a very basic shadow puzzle for the player to understand the concept of the game. 
The second level would serve to improve upon the above in every way, most notably by introducing the a second axis of rotation for the object, making the matching of the shadow more difficult. 
The third level would then add another control axis in the form of letting players control the light source directly.

The first level was easy enough to design. The player spawns in and immediately is introduced to a pressure switch that opens a door. Stepping off the switch closes the door, but not before the player can enter the area of the first puzzle. Here 
players will first encounter a pressure switch puzzle.

The door ahead required for progression requires two switches to be activated, but there is only one physics cube the players can use to press down on the switch. In the shadows, however, 
there is a third switch that opens a rather conspicuous side door in the room. Players will first have to activate this switch in order to open the side door and retrieve the second cube which can then be used to activate both switches at the front door in order to progress.

Following a large, looping path that gives the player an overview of their progress, they will then find themselves at the first basic shadow puzzle. Before that, however, players will have to activate a lightswitch in order to actually cast a shadow that they can use to
guide themselves. The puzzle itself will have the players just match the silhouette of a cross onto the wall behind, which will activate the final door that players can go through to begin the next level.
