The second level was a bit more difficult to design. Utilizing the idea of a night setting, the player's main objective would be to open the ceiling of the level in order to let in the light source that would allow them to match the shadow puzzle to complete the level. 
However, the setup for this final puzzle would first require the player to solve some physics puzzles using the cubes and switch system from before.

In the opening of the level, the player is immediately presented with a cube in a dark room lit only by the ambient background light. The small atrium ahead is actually the final puzzle. In theory, players could rotate the shape into its correct position 
and immediately finish the level. However, with no shadow to guide them on whether they're making any progress, they will instead have to engage in the smaller puzzles first.

The first puzzle is a simple pressure switch requiring the cube from before. This opens the room to reveal a second cube that will be needed in order to complete the puzzle. Additionally, players can find a lightswitch within the level to light up the room in order to
better navigate the level.

A staircase will guide the players to a second floor where they can once again turn on a set of lights for better clarity. Here they will be presented with a puzzle of pressing down both switches in the facing rooms in order to open the ceiling to light 
the final shadow puzzle. Here players will have to use both cubes from before in order to retrieve an additional third cube and place it on the respective switches leading to the level lighting up as below.

As once can see, the shadow puzzle will now be visible and players will have an idea of what shape the shadow needs to be in order to open the door. A pedestal hints at the correct location of the star needed in order to open the door and proceed onto the final level.
